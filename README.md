# 📝 React + TypeScript ToDo App

A clean, lightweight, and scalable ToDo list application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project is part of a learning initiative to master modern frontend development by practicing real-world component-driven architecture with a focus on clarity, reusability, and maintainability.

## ✨ Features

- ⚛️ Functional components using modern React
- 💡 Type-safe props and state management with TypeScript
- 📦 Local state only (no external state libraries)
- 🎯 Minimalist UI powered by Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Add, complete, and delete tasks
- ⚙️ Component-based modular structure

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.tsx                 # Main component and app logic
├── types.d.ts              # Custom type definitions
├── components/
│   ├── TodoForm.tsx        # Handles new task input
│   ├── TodoList.tsx        # Displays all tasks
│   └── TodoItem.tsx        # Single task with toggle/delete
└── index.css               # Tailwind configuration
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

> This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for an extremely fast development experience.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-ts-todo.git
cd react-ts-todo
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🛠️ Tailwind CSS Setup

> Tailwind is preconfigured. If you clone or fork, make sure `index.css` includes:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And `tailwind.config.js` should point to your React files:

```js
content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]
```

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This project is designed to:

- Solidify foundational React concepts (JSX, props, state, events)
- Practice TypeScript in a real-world app
- Understand component design patterns and local state flow
- Gain confidence with Tailwind utility classes
- Develop mental models for building React UI systems

## 📚 Key Concepts Applied

- `useState` for state management
- Type-safe props using interfaces
- Conditional rendering
- Functional programming patterns
- Clean separation of concerns via components

## 🧩 Future Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

- ⏳ Persist todos in `localStorage`
- 🧪 Add unit tests with Vitest / React Testing Library
- 📁 Use `Context` or `useReducer` for deeper state management
- 🌐 Integrate API (e.g., Firebase or Supabase)
- 🔍 Filtering and search functionality
